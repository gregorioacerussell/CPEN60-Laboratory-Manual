# 16. Below is described how to find the date of Easter in any year. Despite
# its intimidating appearance, this is not a hard problem. Note that [x] is the
# floor function, which for positive numbers just drops the decimal part of the
# number. For instance [3.14] = 3. The floor function is part of the math module.

# Easter is either March (22+d +e) or April (d +eâˆ’9). There is an exception if d = 29 and e = 6.
# In this case, Easter falls one week earlier on April 19. There is another exception if d = 28,
# e = 6, and m = 2, 5, 10, 13, 16, 21, 24, or 39. In this case, Easter falls one week earlier on April
# 18. Write a program that asks the user to enter a year and prints out the date of Easter in that
# year.
